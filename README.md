# Forest-Invasion
SmashTV-Roguelike iOS game.

## Introduction

This game is a Roguelike game based on the _SmashTV_ GameStyle.
I got this idea while playing _Journey of the Prairie King_ and made it in few months.
If you want to play, just compile the game in an iOs device, the interface will adapt.
Most designs were edited by me with itch.io assets or made entirely by me.

Once you've started the game and pushed the play button you end up in the shop place (Where most items are free since the game is still in development). Then you can move on right or down to go to another place where you will be attacked.
There you'll have to use joysticks to attack enemies with your bow. There's 8 possibles directions to fire at.
